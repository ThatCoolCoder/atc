# ATC

Status: is playable, has minor gameplay inconsistencies with original, needs more levels.

Reimplementation of the [version by msharov](https://github.com/msharov/bsd-games), which is itself a reimplementation of the traditional game from BSD.

Written in rust, aims to have identical gameplay to the original, although there are minor changes that have been made to improve playability.

I have not looked at the source code of any other versions except for getting the layout for `Default` level and getting specific values like low fuel threshold.
