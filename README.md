# ATC

Status: is very barely playable, has some problems, not all features implemented

Reimplementation of the [version by msharov](https://github.com/msharov/bsd-games), which is itself a reimplementation of the traditional game from BSD.

Written in rust, aims to have identical gameplay to the original, although there are minor changes that have been made to improve playability.

I have not looked at the source code of any other versions except for getting the layout for `Default` level and getting the right values for plane critical fuel level.
